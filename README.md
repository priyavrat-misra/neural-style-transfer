## About
> This is a basic PyTorch implementation of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. <br>
> The paper presents an algorithm for combining the content of one image with the style of another image using convolutional neural networks. <br>
